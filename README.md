# Retrotink-DV1-Profile-Repository

## Nonsense
This repository was created (and is maintained) by a monster. Their brain worms are akin to Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, forcing their host to perfectly rotate and crop their MiSTer games before they are allowed autonomy. Their suffering is your gain - congratulations.

## Installation
Unzip the pack of your choice into the profile/DV1 folder on your Retrotink 4K's SD Card.

Make sure your MiSTer has `direct_video=1` enabled in your MiSTer.ini and that **Auto-Load DV1** Profiles is set to **ON** in the Retrotink's Profile Menu.

**These profiles require Tink4K firmware 1.9.3 or later and should be compatible with both the CE and Pro models (although you won't get rotation on the CE).**

## My Setup (where these profiles were created)
I have a [Mister Pi (Dual Ram) from RetroRemake](https://retroremake.co/products/misterpi-preorder) hooked up to a [generic Amazon Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC4LGH2C) which is then hooked up to a 77" LG CX in [PC Mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/OLED/comments/j38q67/comment/g7d44aq/).

The God's Chosen profile works fine in this setup.

All profile adjustments are cataloged on [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14QZWZwbQN1FVbOtnZs4nFk9UAn8rdIzWKm78_JN6css/edit?usp=sharing).

## FAQ

### What did you adjust on the Console Cores?
Aside from setting Target Decimation to 1600? Nothing. They look fine to my brain worms.

### Why are some of the games upside down?
**TL;DR: Look for a "flip" dipswitch in the core's Menu**

For some reason, the Tink4k rotates 90 Degrees Left cleaner than 90 Degrees Right so, for my own sanity, I use the flip dip switch (when available) to accommodate that.

I hope that both sides of the pillow are eternally cool for any dev who exposes this dipswitch in the menu.

### Why are there some games that aren't rotated or cropped properly?
There are two possibilities here.

First, I may have just missed it. I am (mostly) human and there are 900+ games here - I probably missed something.

Another possibility is that Toaplan (and Toaplan adjacent) games don't play well with direct video. Most cannot be decimated, cropped, or rotated correctly. Until they receive updates, there isn't much I can do.

In either case, please file an [issue](https://github.com/TheJesusFish/Retrotink-DV1-Profile-Repository/issues) for the non-rotated profile (if one doesn't exist already). This will help me immensely.

### Why is a profile for [game] missing?
Probably because the game was released after I released a pack for the month. I'm going to try to release around the beginning of every month, but that means that there will be a period of time every month where new cores aren't yet in the zip.

In those instances, I will try to keep the /Raw Files/To Be Released/[name of pack] up to date with any new cores that aren't in the latest zipfile. If you don't want to wait for a formal release, you can download the individual profiles there and add them to your SD card.

(But - and look me in the eye here - if you don't have the stamina to adjust one or two games yourself, what are we even doing here?)

### Can I request a set based on different CRT profiles?
Totally. Please post an [issue](https://github.com/TheJesusFish/Retrotink-DV1-Profile-Repository/issues) for the combo you'd like. If an issue already exists, just +1 it. If something gets a bunch of votes, or I find it interesting, I'll make a set and add it to the releases.
