# Retrotink-DV1-Profile-Repository
A repository for folks with brain worms and a penchant for poor financial decisions

## Nonsense
This repository was created (and is maintained) by a monster. Their brain worms are akin to Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, forcing their host to perfectly rotate and crop their MiSTer games before they are allowed autonomy. Their suffering is your gain - congratulations.

## Installation
Unzip the pack of your choice into the profiles/DV1 folder on your Retrotink 4K's SD Card. 

Make sure your MiSTer has `direct_video=1` enabled in your MiSTer.ini and that **Auto-Load DV1** Profiles is set to **ON** in the Retrotink's Profile Menu.

## FAQ

### Why are some of the games upside down?
**TL;DR: Look for a "flip" dipswitch in the core's Menu**

For some reason, the Tink4k rotates 90 Degrees Left cleaner than 90 Degrees right so, for my own sanity, I use the flip dip switch (when available) to accomodate that.

I hope that both sides of the pillow are eternally cool for any dev who exposes this dipswitch in the menu.

### Why are there some games that aren't rotated or cropped properly?
Some Toaplan (and Toaplan adjacent) games don't play well with direct video and cannot be decimated, cropped, or rotated correctly. Until they receive updates, there isn't much I can do.

### Why is a profile for [game] missing?
Probably because the game was released after I released a pack for the month. I'm going to try to release towards the end of every month, but that means that there will be a period of time every month where new cores aren't yet in the zip.

In those instances, I will try to keep the /Raw Files/To Be Merged/[name of pack] up to date with any new cores that aren't in the latest zipfile. If you don't want to wait for a formal release, you can download the individual profiles there and add them to your SD card (but, and look me in the eye, if you don't have the stamina to adjust one or two games yourself, what are we even doing here?)
